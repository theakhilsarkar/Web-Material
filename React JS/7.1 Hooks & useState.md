# 📘 **Lecture 7.1: Introduction of Hooks in React – `useState`**

---

## 🔷 What are React Hooks?

### 📖 **Definition:**

Hooks are **functions** introduced in **React 16.8** that allow you to **use state and lifecycle features in functional components** — without writing a class.

> 💡 In simple terms: Hooks = Power of Class Components in Functional Components

---

## 🧠 Why Hooks?

Before Hooks:

* You had to use **class components** to manage state and lifecycle.
* Functional components were **stateless** and used for only UI purposes.

After Hooks:

* You can write fully featured components using **just functions**.
* Cleaner, reusable, and more readable code.

## 🧪 The `useState()` Hook

### 📖 **Definition:**

`useState` is a React Hook that allows you to add **state variables** in functional components.

### 🔧 **Syntax:**

```js
const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
```

* `state`: current value of the state
* `setState`: function to update the state
* `initialValue`: initial/default value for the state (string, number, array, object, etc.)

---

## 💻 Basic Example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0); // Initial value is 0

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrease</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## 🎯 Practical Use Cases

| Use Case                  | State Type | Example          |
| ------------------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| Toggle button             | Boolean    | `useState(true)` |
| Input field value         | String     | `useState('')`   |
| Counter or number updates | Number     | `useState(0)`    |
| Store a list of items     | Array      | `useState([])`   |
| Manage object like a form | Object     | `useState({})`   |

---

## 🛠 Real-world Example: Form Input

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function NameForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState('');

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        placeholder="Enter your name"
        value={name}
        onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
      />
      <p>Hello, {name}</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Points

* You can use **multiple `useState`** hooks in a single component.
* Updating state with `setState` causes the component to **re-render**.
* `useState` is called **inside the component**, not outside or in loops.

---

## 🧠 Interview Tip:

> **Q:** What is `useState` in React?
>
> **A:** It’s a hook that lets you add local state to functional components. It returns a state variable and a function to update it.

---

## ✅ Summary

* `useState` brings **state management** into functional components.
* It makes components more **powerful and flexible**.
* One of the **most used hooks** in React development.
