Title: Express + MongoDB Filter API Practical Task

Task Description:

Create a project using Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose where a student must build multiple GET routes to filter data of a product collection. The product collection must contain minimum fields: productName, category, brand, price, rating, description, createdAt.

Requirements:

1. Create a REST API with the following GET routes:
   a) Fetch all products.
   b) Fetch products by ID.
   c) Search products by productName (case insensitive search).
   d) Search products by brand.
   e) Search products by multiple fields combined (productName + category + brand).
   f) Fetch products by category (category should come from query parameter).
   g) Filter products by price range (min and max price from query).
   h) Filter products by rating above a given value.
   i) Route for sorting products (sort by price ascending or descending based on query parameter).
   j) Pagination route:

   * Accept page number and limit from query
   * Return products for the requested page
   * Also return total count of products and total pages.

2. Explanation of pagination for students:
   Pagination is the method of dividing large datasets into smaller parts based on page number and limit, so instead of sending all items at once, only a specific subset of items is sent for each request.
   Example: If there are 100 products and limit=10, then page 1 returns product 1–10, page 2 returns 11–20, page 3 returns 21–30, and so on.

3. Error handling:
   If no result is found for any filter, API should return a message: "No products found".

4. Bonus condition:
   Allow two or more filters to work together in a single API (example: category + price range + rating + sort + page).

5. Students must demonstrate API testing in Postman.

Output:
Only backend API is required. No frontend is needed.
