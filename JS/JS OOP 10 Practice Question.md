### ✅ **Encapsulation (Questions 1–3)**

1. **Create a `Car` class** that has `brand` and `model` properties. Use a constructor to initialize them. Create a method `getDetails()` that returns the full name of the car.

2. **Create a `Person` class** that stores `name` and `age`. Make `age` private (use closure or `#age`) and provide methods to `getAge()` and `setAge()` safely.

3. **Create a `User` class** where the `password` should be private. Add methods to `changePassword()` and `checkPassword()`.

---

### ✅ **Abstraction (Questions 4–5)**

4. **Create a `Calculator` class** that hides the internal result property (e.g., using `#result`). Add methods to `add(num)`, `subtract(num)`, and `getResult()`.

5. **Create a `BankAccount` class** where `balance` is private. Add `deposit(amount)`, `withdraw(amount)`, and `getBalance()` methods. Try to access balance directly (it should not work).

### ✅ **Inheritance (Questions 6–7)**

6. **Create a `Vehicle` class** with a method `move()`. Then create a `Bike` class that extends `Vehicle`. Create an object of `Bike` and call the `move()` method.

7. **Create a `Person` class** with a method `greet()`. Create a `Student` class that extends `Person` and adds a method `study()`. Use both methods on a `Student` object.

---

### ✅ **Polymorphism (Questions 8–10)**

8. **Create a `Bird` class** with a method `makeSound()`. Then create `Sparrow` and `Parrot` classes that override the `makeSound()` method with their unique sounds.

9. **Create a `Shape` class** with a method `area()`. Then create `Circle` and `Square` classes that extend `Shape` and implement their own `area()` logic.

10. **Create an array of `Shape` objects** (like Circle and Square) and use a `forEach()` loop to print the area of each shape. This demonstrates polymorphism in action.
