# 📘 React Lecture 5.1: State and Props

Welcome to Lecture 5.1 of ReactJS — In this lecture, we will dive into **State** and **Props**, the two most fundamental concepts of React development.

## 🧩 What is State?

### 📖 Definition:

In React, **state** is a built-in object that stores property values that belong to the component. When the state changes, React **re-renders** the component.

### 🛠️ Usage:

State is managed inside the component using the `useState()` hook (for functional components).

### 🧪 Example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h3>Count: {count}</h3>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### ✅ Use Cases:

* Tracking input field values
* Toggling themes
* Handling counters or timers

---

## 📦 What are Props?

### 📖 Definition:

**Props** (short for **properties**) are **read-only** attributes used to pass data from a **parent component** to a **child component**.

### 🛠️ Usage:

Props are passed as attributes in the JSX tag and received as arguments inside the child component.

### 🧪 Example:

```jsx
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
}

function App() {
  return <Welcome name="Akhil" />;
}
```

### ✅ Use Cases:

* Passing user data
* Reusing UI components with different values
* Passing functions to children

## 🆚 Difference between State and Props

| Feature         | Props                         | State                           |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| **Mutable**     | ❌ No                          | ✅ Yes                           |
| **Ownership**   | Parent component              | Component itself                |
| **Usage**       | Data flow to child components | Managing internal UI behavior   |
| **Can Change?** | No                            | Yes (via `setState`/`useState`) |
| **Reusability** | Excellent                     | Limited                         |

## 💡 Example Use Case

Let’s say we’re building a **User Profile Viewer**.

### `App.js`

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import User from './User';

function App() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("Akhil");
  return <User username={name} />;
}
```

### `User.js`

```jsx
function User({ username }) {
  return <h2>Welcome, {username}</h2>;
}
```

* `username` is passed as **props** to `User`
* `name` is stored and changed using **state** in `App`

## 🎯 Summary

| Concept | Role in React                    | Example Keyword |
| ------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- |
| State   | Local component data             | `useState()`    |
| Props   | Data passed from parent to child | `props.<name>`  |

---

## ✅ Quick Practice Task

Create a component:

* That shows a name using **props**
* Includes a button that toggles visibility using **state**
