### ✅ **1. What is SEO?**

**SEO (Search Engine Optimization)** is the process of optimizing your website so it ranks higher on search engines like **Google**, increasing organic (unpaid) traffic. ([Wikipedia][2])

* Helps people find your website when they search for relevant keywords.
* Organic traffic is valuable because it brings users actively searching for your content or product. ([Wikipedia][2])

### 🧠 **2. How Search Engines Work**

Search engines like Google use **crawlers** (bots) to scan the web → index pages → and rank them based on relevance and quality.
When someone searches for a term, the engine shows what it considers the most relevant pages. ([Google for Developers][3])

Key Concepts:

* **Crawling** — bots discover pages on your site.
* **Indexing** — Google stores and understands pages.
* **Ranking** — Google decides where you appear in results.
