# 📘 What is DSA?

**DSA = Data Structures + Algorithms**

### ✅ Data Structure

A **data structure** is a way to **store and organize data** in memory so that it can be used efficiently.

Examples:
Array, Stack, Queue, Linked List, Tree, Graph, Hash Table

---

### ✅ Algorithm

An **algorithm** is a **step-by-step procedure** to solve a problem using data.

Examples:
Searching, Sorting, Traversing, Path finding

---

### 📌 In simple words:

> **Data Structure = How data is stored**
> **Algorithm = How data is processed**

Together they make programs:
✔ Faster
✔ Efficient
✔ Scalable

# 🎯 Why Should We Learn DSA?

We learn DSA because:

1. ✅ It improves **problem-solving skills**
2. ✅ Helps write **optimized code**
3. ✅ Makes programs **faster**
4. ✅ Required for **placements & interviews**
5. ✅ Used in **real-world software** (Google, Amazon, etc.)
6. ✅ Helps handle **large data**
7. ✅ Makes you a **better developer**
