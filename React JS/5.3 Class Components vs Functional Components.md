# 📘 **Lecture 5.3: Functional Components vs Class Components in React**

---

## 🔷 What is a Component in React?

A **Component** is a **reusable building block** of a React application. Every UI part you see (buttons, navbar, footer, cards, forms) is made using components.

There are two types of components:

1. **Functional Components**
2. **Class Components**

---

## ✅ 1. Functional Component

### 📖 **Definition:**

A **Functional Component** is a JavaScript function that returns JSX (React elements). It is **stateless** by default but can use state and other features via **React Hooks** (`useState`, `useEffect`, etc.).

> 💡 Functional components are now the most commonly used and recommended type in React.

### 🧪 **Example:**

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Count: {count}</h2>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increase</button>
    </div>
  );
}

export default Counter;
```

---

## ✅ 2. Class Component

### 📖 **Definition:**

A **Class Component** is an **ES6 class** that extends `React.Component` and requires a `render()` method that returns JSX. It has its own **state** and **lifecycle methods**.

> 💡 Class components were the only way to handle state before hooks were introduced in React 16.8.

### 🧪 **Example:**

```jsx
import React, { Component } from 'react';

class Counter extends Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h2>Count: {this.state.count}</h2>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Increase
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default Counter;
```

## 🔁 Difference Between Functional and Class Components

| Feature                 | Functional Component              | Class Component                                  |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Syntax                  | JavaScript function               | ES6 class that extends `Component`               |
| State Handling          | Uses `useState()` hook            | Uses `this.state` and `this.setState`            |
| Lifecycle Methods       | Uses `useEffect()` hook           | Has lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount()` |
| Simplicity              | Simple and concise                | Verbose and more complex                         |
| Performance             | Slightly better in newer versions | Slightly heavier                                 |
| `this` Keyword          | No need for `this`                | Must use `this` for accessing props/state        |
| Popularity (as of 2025) | ✅ Most used and recommended       | Legacy (still supported but less used)           |

## 🔍 Use Case:

| Use Case                            | Best Component Type     |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Small reusable UI components        | Functional              |
| Large components with complex logic | Functional (with hooks) |
| Old React Codebase                  | Class                   |

## 🧑‍💻 Practical Example Project Idea

### 🎯 Task: **Create a counter in both component styles**

* Show a counter value
* Add increment and decrement buttons
* Show the total button clicks

This lets students see **exact difference in code structure** and understand how each approach works.

## 📌 Summary

* **Functional Components** are the modern way to write components in React.
* They are simpler, shorter, and use hooks to manage state/lifecycle.
* **Class Components** are still valid but mainly seen in older codebases.
