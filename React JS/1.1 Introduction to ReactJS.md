### 📅 Timeline

* **2011** – Concept used in Facebook's newsfeed
* **2013** – Publicly released as **open-source**
* **2015** – Introduction of **React Native**
* **2016+** – React grows rapidly in popularity, ecosystem expands

### 🔁 Why React Was Created

Before React, front-end development faced issues like:

* Difficult DOM updates
* Poor performance
* Complex code maintenance
* Lack of reusability

React solved these problems using:

* **Virtual DOM**
* **Component-based architecture**
* **One-way data flow**

### 🏢 Who uses React?

* Facebook (Meta)
* Instagram
* WhatsApp
* Airbnb
* Netflix
* Uber

## 🌟 2. Overview and Features of ReactJS

React is a **library**, not a framework, designed for creating **declarative**, **efficient**, and **flexible** user interfaces.

### ⚙️ Core Features

| Feature                      | Description                                      |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **JSX**                      | JavaScript XML – allows HTML in JS               |
| **Components**               | Encapsulated reusable building blocks            |
| **Virtual DOM**              | Efficient DOM updates for performance            |
| **Unidirectional Data Flow** | Predictable state and props handling             |
| **Lifecycle Methods**        | Control component behavior across stages         |
| **Hooks**                    | Add state and lifecycle in functional components |

### 💡 JSX Example

```jsx
const Greeting = () => <h1>Hello, React!</h1>;
```

### 📊 Visual: Virtual DOM vs Real DOM

> 📝 React creates a virtual copy of the real DOM and updates only the parts that change.

## 🚀 3. Advantages of ReactJS

React stands out in the JavaScript ecosystem due to these benefits:

### ✅ Performance

* Uses **Virtual DOM** for faster rendering
* Optimises unnecessary re-rendering

### ✅ Reusability

* **Component-based architecture** allows reusable UI blocks
* Promotes clean and maintainable code

### ✅ Developer Experience

* Supports **React DevTools** in Chrome/Firefox
* Works well with **modern editors** like VS Code
* Clean syntax via **JSX**

### ✅ Ecosystem & Community

* Massive open-source community
* Thousands of npm packages & tools
* Easy integration with other libraries like Redux, React Router

### ✅ Scalability

* Suitable for **small** to **large-scale apps**
* Works with SSR (Next.js), Native apps (React Native), etc.
